## Organization Agreement

### Logistical

- We will be able to communicate from 10a - 9p on slack.
- We will take small breaks every 1-2 hours.
- If we start to fall behind we can both skip over the aesthics of the frontend work and also get work done on our own time, then run through the updates together.

### Cooperative

- Make a list of each parsonâ€™s strengths.

Rhetts strengths are being a team player and understanding react and express fundamentals.
Jacobs strengths are css and express!

- How can you best utilize these strengths in the development of your application?

We can utilize these strengths by making sure eachothers work is accounted for and up to date.

- In what areas do you each want to develop greater strength?

Throughout this exercise Rhett & Jake wants to develop a better understanding of MongoDB, Mongoose and a new css feature.

- Knowing that every person in your team needs to understand the code, how do you plan to approach the day-to-day development?

We plan to approach the days by getting together and discussing what we should work on before we get to work. And routinely filling eachother in on any headway or roadblocks.

### Conflict Resolution

- What will your team do if one person is pulling all the weight while the other person is not contributing?

"It doesn't matter who writes the code, everyone has the right to understand it."

- How will you approach each other and the challenge of building an application knowing that it is impossible for two people to be at the exact same place in understanding and skill level?

"Sucking at something is the first step at kind of being good at something."
